# Manage Your Jobs

## Status transitions

You can select one or more jobs by clicking on the checkboxes next to each job. Once jobs are selected, you can perform actions on them using the buttons at the top of the table. The available actions include:

- **Reschedule**: Reschedules the selected jobs.
- **Kill**: Marks the selected jobs to be killed.
- **Delete**: Marks the selected jobs for deletion.

**Note**:  
- You can only delete jobs that are already killed.  
- A job cannot typically be rescheduled more than three times.

## View a Job's History

You can right-click on a job to open its **Job History**.  
The history shows the different statuses the job has gone through, along with the corresponding dates and the authors of the changes.
