# The Search Bar

The search bar allows you to filter jobs based on various criteria. Filters are represented as equations, where each equation consists of a job attribute, an operator, and a value. The search bar analyzes these equations to evaluate their consistency. A green equation is valid, a yellow equation is incomplete, and a red equation is invalid.

A search is automatically performed when all equations in the search bar are valid.

## Create a Filter

To create a filter, click on the search bar and start typing. Suggestions will appear based on the available job attributes. You can select a suggestion to choose the criterion. After that, you can either type or select an operator and a value to filter by.  
The search bar only suggests attributes, operators, and values that are available in your current set of jobs.

## Edit a Filter

To edit a filter, click on it in the search bar. You can change the operator or value by clicking on them. You can also use the arrow keys to navigate through the equations and edit them. Press `ESCAPE` to return to the end of the search bar.

## Remove a Filter

To remove a filter, press the `Backspace` key to remove the last token, or right-click on the equation to remove the entire equation.  
You can also clear the entire search bar by clicking on the trash can button at the end of the search bar.
