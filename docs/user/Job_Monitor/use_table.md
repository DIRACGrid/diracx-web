# The Table

The table displays the jobs that match the criteria specified in the search bar. Each row represents a job, and the columns show various attributes of the job, such as its ID, status, type, and submission date.

## Change the Visibility

You can click on the eye icon to select additional columns to display in the table. Some columns are hidden by default.

You can sort the table by clicking on the column headers. Clicking once will sort the table in ascending order; clicking again will sort it in descending order.

You can set the page size by using the `Rows per page` dropdown at the bottom of the table. This allows you to control how many jobs are displayed per page.

## Select a Job

You can select one or multiple jobs using the checkboxes on the left side of the table.  
Once you have selected at least one job, you can perform actions on it. You can manage the selected jobs or copy their IDs to your clipboard.
