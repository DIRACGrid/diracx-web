# Managing Application Instances

An *application instance* is a graphical web interface that allows users to interact with DiracX services. DiracX-Web is essentially a collection of such applications, and users can "spawn" instances to interact with them.

By default, a few application instances are displayed (e.g., `My Jobs`, an instance of `Job Monitor`). This guide will help you manage, organize, and share application instances effectively.
